# This theme is marked as @internal. It is intended to evolve and change over
# minor releases.
# Although we are sub-theming Olivero within Drupal CMS, sub-theming Olivero is
# explicitly not supported by Drupal core. This is intended as a stop-gap
# measure to provide great looking content types and components before a more
# robust design system can be implemented.
