# A list of forms that should be presented to the user before choosing database
# settings and installing the system. Each of these forms must implement
# \Drupal\RecipeKit\Installer\FormInterface.
forms:
  - '\Drupal\RecipeKit\Installer\Form\RecipesForm'
  - '\Drupal\RecipeKit\Installer\Form\SiteNameForm'

recipes:
  # This should be a list of recipes' Composer package names that should always be
  # applied during the install process.
  required: []

  # This should be a set of recipe combinations to show to the user as choices at the
  # start of the install process. The keys can be any machine name (such as `blog`),
  # and the values should be associative arrays with two elements:
  # - `name`: The human-readable name of the combination, which will be shown to users.
  # - `packages`: A list of the Composer package names of the recipes in this combination.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # special:
  #   name: Special Sauce
  #   packages:
  #     - drupal/drupal_cms_blog
  #     - kanopi/gin-admin-experience
  #
  optional: {}

# This allows you to suppress messages set by the Drupal installer, or various modules,
# which you might not want to display to users during or after the install process.
# Each item in this list can either be a string, which is the untranslated message
# to suppress, or an array of two untranslated strings for pluralized messages which
# have singular and plural forms.
hide_messages: []

# This allows the installer to download the appropriate translations if needed; don't
# change it unless you know what you're doing.
